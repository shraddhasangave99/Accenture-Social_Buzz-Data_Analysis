🔹 In short, the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

## Task- 2
### Data Cleaning & Modeling
🔹Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

🔹So, the first step is to use this [Data Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsW1pSPR3tby8gMk4uHMPSfvPVYbu2pA/view?usp=drive_link) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

🔹After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:

1. Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
2. Content ID
3. Reaction Types
4. Content type
5. Category

#### Data Cleaning:

Clean the data by:-

  1.Removing rows that have values which are missing.

  2.Changing the data type of some values within a column.

  3.Removing columns which are not relevant to this task.

  4.Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

End result will be three cleaned data set :
